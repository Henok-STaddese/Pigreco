# 🛰️ InaSAFE + QGIS Desktop (via Docker)

This Dockerized environment provides a complete **QGIS Desktop** setup with the **InaSAFE** plugin preinstalled and ready to run directly in your **browser** using a Linux XFCE desktop (via noVNC).

---

## 📦 What's Included

- **Ubuntu 20.04**
- **QGIS LTR (Long-Term Release)** from the official QGIS repository
- **InaSAFE** plugin (installed via `qgis-plugin-manager`)
- **XFCE4 desktop environment**
- **VNC server** and **noVNC** for browser-based GUI access
- **Auto-launching QGIS**
- **Persistent access to your Mac Desktop files** (optional mount)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🔨 Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t inasafe-qgis-ltr .
```

---

### 🖥️ Run the Container

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 6080:6080 \
  --shm-size=2g \
  -v ~/Desktop:/root/Desktop \
  --name inasafe-qgis \
  inasafe-qgis-ltr
```

> This mounts your Mac's **Desktop** folder into the container at `/root/Desktop`.

---

### 🌐 Access the GUI

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:6080
```

- You’ll see a Linux XFCE desktop in your browser.
- QGIS will launch automatically.
- **InaSAFE** will already be installed and enabled.
- You can access your files in `/root/Desktop`.

---

## 📂 Saving and Accessing Files

Save and open files in:

```
/root/Desktop
```

Which maps directly to your real Mac desktop (`~/Desktop`), allowing full persistence between sessions.

## 🧱 Project Structure

```
inasafe-qgis-docker/
├── Dockerfile       # Installs QGIS + InaSAFE + XFCE + noVNC
├── startup.sh       # Starts XFCE and QGIS in a VNC session
└── README.md        # This file
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **White screen in browser?**  
  Make sure `startxfce4` is present in the `~/.vnc/xstartup` file

- **Browser not connecting?**  
  Ensure Docker is running and you used `--shm-size=2g`

- **Plugin not found?**  
  Check that `InaSAFE` is correctly installed using the proper case (`InaSAFE`, not `inasafe`)
